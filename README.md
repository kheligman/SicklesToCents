# SicklesToCents
Harry Potter Currency Converter
I decided to make this project because I realized there was a hole in my education.  I did not know almost anything about web development.
I wanted to brush up my skills on HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I decided to make this little quick example of a Harry Potter currency converter to give me an easy, fun way to practice.
I took online Javascript tutorials on w3Schools.

Another bonus I hope to use this website for is to practice learning search engine optomization.  I would want this to be the first Harry
Potter conversion site that comes up when someone looks for it.
